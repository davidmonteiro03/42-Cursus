# INCEPTION

## Virtual Machine Part

### Operating System

- I used <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=22.04.3&architecture=amd64">Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS</a> to do this project, because it's good OS to this specific subject (I normally use Windows, so it was to obvious to choose another one). To run it, I used <a href="https://www.oracle.com/pt/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html">Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager</a>.
